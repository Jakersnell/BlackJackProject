# Black Jack Project

# Description
This Project is a simulation of a blackjack table and game. The user is able to play as many rounds of blackjack as they want, where they can decide if they would like to hit or stand. The game logic is then applied to decide if the player wins or loses, and the dealer game logic decides how the dealer must play. The project is a CLI game, but the game is still rather complex due to the amount of interacting components, and their OOP nature.
# Tech used
The project is written in Java 8, using extensive OOP principles, applying game logic, and structuring techniques. For the game loop itself I used an event based approach with a Java Stack<T> as the event queue, seeing as I would only need to access the item at the top of the stack. The event based nature provides a lot of benefits, including supportive structure for future additions to the program.
# Lessons learned
I learned a lot about mindful work-flow during this project, I found myself overwhelmed by the multitude of places I could be finding a bug, but through stepping through the system piece by piece I was able to overcome these challenges, and learn quite a bit from them. Any opportunity to practice finding and solving a bug, is much appreciated.
